I am not the longest.
I am totally the longest line in this file. I hope it is over 80 characters by the time I finish typing it.
I copped out and did not consider if a
line is longer than 100 chars.
There seems to be something in my vim config that auto breaks the line at 80 characters. While this is normally interesting, I find it hard to have to use J everytime I want to break that rule.
